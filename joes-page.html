        <p>
            I am an avid outdoor enthusiast who enjoys running, biking, hiking, fishing, and camping. I find joy in staying active and connected to nature. <br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Iowa, with an expected graduation in December 2025. My academic journey has been enriched by my role as a teaching assistant in an electronics class. Additionally, I work as a part-time student quality engineer at John Deere. I have a passion for continuous learning, which inspired me to create my personal website to showcase my projects and skills.

                <li><span>Running</span><br>I enjoy running, particularly trail running, and have completed three half marathons. It's a great way to wrap up a great day, allowing me to unwind.</li>
                <li><span>Biking</span><br>I bike commute to class every day and love finding new paths to ride. Exploring new routes keeps my daily rides exciting and fresh.</li>
                <li><span>Fishing</span><br>I love fishing in creeks. Hooking into a monster small mouth is an exhilarating feeling that keeps me coming back for more.</li>
                <li><span>Camping</span><br>I've loved camping since I was a kid. I enjoy being outdoors in the woods, and there's something special about cooking food over the fire at night, surrounded by nature.</li>

                <li><span>LTspice</span><br>I have extensive experience using LTspice in both academic settings and as a teaching assistant. In my coursework, I've applied the software for various circuit simulations and analyses, gaining a deep understanding of its features. As a TA, I've also guided students who are new to the software, helping them develop confidence in circuit modeling and analysis.</li>
                <li><span>Object Oriented Programming</span><br>Object-oriented programming has been a core aspect of my development journey. I've coded multiple games, including a retro-style asteroid game in C++ and a platformer using a game engine. These projects allowed me to apply principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while working on engaging, interactive games.</li>
                <li><span>MATLAB</span><br>I've utilized MATLAB for a range of projects, including designing a PID controller and working on digital signal processing. These experiences have honed my ability to leverage MATLAB's powerful toolsets for real-world engineering applications, from control systems to signal analysis.</li>
