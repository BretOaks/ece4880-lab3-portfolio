        <p>
            Born and raised in Chicago, I enjoy watching sports, golfing and spending time with friends and family. Whether its a casual game or just hanging out, I value good company and staying active. <br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Iowa, with an expected graduation in December 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I've built a strong foundation in electrical engineering with hands-on experience in circuit design, power systems and embedded technologies. Looking ahead, my goal is to apply my skills in the power systems industry, contribute to innovative energy solutions, and eventually purse licensure as a Professional Engineer.

                <li><span>LTspice</span><br>I have extensive experience using LTspice in both academic settings and as a teaching assistant. In my coursework, I've applied the software for various circuit simulations and analyses, gaining a deep understanding of its features. As a TA, I've also guided students who are new to the software, helping them develop confidence in circuit modeling and analysis.</li>
                <li><span>Object Oriented Programming</span><br>Object-oriented programming has been a core aspect of my development journey. I've coded multiple games, including a retro-style asteroid game in C++ and a platformer using a game engine. These projects allowed me to apply principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while working on engaging, interactive games.</li>
                <li><span>MATLAB</span><br>I've utilized MATLAB for a range of projects, including designing a PID controller and working on digital signal processing. These experiences have honed my ability to leverage MATLAB's powerful toolsets for real-world engineering applications, from control systems to signal analysis.</li>
