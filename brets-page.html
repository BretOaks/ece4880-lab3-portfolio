        <p>
            Born and raised in Chicago, I enjoy watching sports, golfing and spending time with friends and family. Whether its a casual game or just hanging out, I value good company and staying active. <br><br>Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Iowa, with an expected graduation in December 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I've built a strong foundation in electrical engineering with hands-on experience in circuit design, power systems and embedded technologies. Looking ahead, my goal is to apply my skills in the power systems industry, contribute to innovative energy solutions, and eventually purse licensure as a Professional Engineer.
