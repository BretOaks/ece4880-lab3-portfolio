                <li><span>Guitar</span><br>I enjoy running, particularly trail running, and have completed three half marathons. It's a great way to wrap up a great day, allowing me to unwind.</li>
                <li><span>Traveling</span><br>I bike commute to class every day and love finding new paths to ride. Exploring new routes keeps my daily rides exciting and fresh.</li>
                <li><span>Skiing</span><br>I love fishing in creeks. Hooking into a monster small mouth is an exhilarating feeling that keeps me coming back for more.</li>

                <li><span>LTspice</span><br>I have extensive experience using LTspice in both academic settings and as a teaching assistant. In my coursework, I've applied the software for various circuit simulations and analyses, gaining a deep understanding of its features. As a TA, I've also guided students who are new to the software, helping them develop confidence in circuit modeling and analysis.</li>
                <li><span>Object Oriented Programming</span><br>Object-oriented programming has been a core aspect of my development journey. I've coded multiple games, including a retro-style asteroid game in C++ and a platformer using a game engine. These projects allowed me to apply principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism while working on engaging, interactive games.</li>
                <li><span>MATLAB</span><br>I've utilized MATLAB for a range of projects, including designing a PID controller and working on digital signal processing. These experiences have honed my ability to leverage MATLAB's powerful toolsets for real-world engineering applications, from control systems to signal analysis.</li>

                <li><span>Teaching Assistant</span><br>As a teaching assistant for two semesters in an electronics class, I've had the opportunity to guide students through hands-on learning by helping them construct circuits and conduct precise measurements. Serving as the lead lab instructor, I addressed student inquiries by breaking down complex concepts into easily understandable explanations.</li>
                <li><span>Vice President</span><br>I currently serve as the vice president for the University of Iowa Fantasy Football Organization. In this role, I help lead the group's initiatives, maintain the website, and foster a collaborative environment where members can connect, share ideas, and grow personally.</li>
