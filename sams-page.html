        <p>
            I am a big fan of music. I play guitar and love to jam with friends. I also enjoy skiing and snowboading. <br> I am an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Iowa with a focus in Power Systems. I plan on graduating in December 2025. I have a passion for learning and am always looking for new challenges. I created this personal website to showcase my projects and skills. I am excited to share my journey with you!<br><br>

                <li><span>MATLAB</span><br>I’ve applied MATLAB across a variety of engineering challenges, including modeling control systems and processing audio signals. From implementing Fourier analysis to tuning PID controllers, I’ve developed a strong grasp of MATLAB’s capabilities for simulation, data visualization, and algorithm development in both coursework and project settings</li>
                <li><span>AutoCAD Revit</span><br>I've used AutoCAD in both academic and professional environments, primarily for creating precise 2D electrical schematics and layouts. Through my internship experience, I’ve developed a solid understanding of drafting standards and efficient drawing practices, allowing me to contribute effectively to engineering documentation.</li>
                <li><span>MATLAB</span><br>I’ve applied Python to a variety of technical problems, from data analysis and automation to signal processing. My projects have included audio filtering using FFTs and automating tasks for engineering workflows, showcasing my ability to write clear, modular code that integrates well with engineering toolchains.</li>

                <li><span>Shive-Hattery Intern</span><br>As an Academic Research Assistant, I worked hands-on with large-scale aquatic models used in water resource research. My role included constructing, maintaining, and transporting these models using university vehicles. I also kept the lab’s shop space organized and functional, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations for ongoing experiments and fabrication tasks.</li>
                <li><span>ESCO Group Intern</span><br>During my internship as an Electrical Engineering Intern, I contributed to building design projects by modeling and simulating electrical systems in Revit and AGI32. I collaborated closely with architects and engineers to create integrated solutions for lighting, power, and systems layouts. My work also extended to on-site visits, where I assessed construction progress and helped verify design implementations.</li>
                <li><span>IIHR Academic Research Assistant</span><br>As an Automation Associate, I programmed, configured, and tested PLC and HMI-based control systems for clients including Quaker and John Deere. I supported control panel design by working with AutoCAD Electrical drawing packages, and regularly led team meetings to review progress and align on weekly goals. This role strengthened both my technical and communication skills in a professional automation environment.</li>
